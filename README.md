# hello-world
Getting my feet wet.
I am sick and tired of working at deadend sales jobs. I am more than ready for a career change. I cannot wait to learn how to build things. Goal: to become a carpenter with symbols who builds beautifully addictive apps and webpages.
I want the ability to work with small teams, but also have the option to work remotely. Ultimate goal will be to build my own company(s) and create passive income. 
With money made from coding, I will be able to buy houses/apts/land in smaller housing markets nationwide in areas experiencing growth so I can make $$ in equity and roll it over into buying more properties.

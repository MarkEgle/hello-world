# hello-world
Getting my feet wet.
I now work for a software company that builds software for developers. I think it is important that I begin my journey as an engineer so I can speak the language. I cannot wait to learn how to build things. 

Goal: to become a carpenter with symbols who builds beautifully addictive apps and webpages.
I want the ability to work with small teams, but also have the option to work remotely. Ultimate goal will be to build my own company(s) and create passive income. 

With money made from coding, I will be able to buy houses/apts/land in smaller housing markets nationwide in areas experiencing growth so I can make $$ in equity and roll it over into buying more properties.

I want to establish sources of passive income so I can spend more time exploring, learning how to play new songs on guitar, and work on art projects without worry or guilt that I should be focusing on money generation.
